  <h1>Why We're Building in the Open</h1>
  <p class="hero-subtitle">
    This entire proposal—research, planning, and development—lives in a public GitHub repository. Here's why.

    <h3>We're Public Servants</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    We work for the public. Our ideas, funded by taxpayer time and resources, should be 
    accessible to the public whenever possible. Working in the open is a natural extension 
    of transparency in government.

    <h3>Practicing What We Preach</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Our proposal is about <em>open, federated technology</em>. It would be contradictory 
    to advocate for open platforms while developing our proposal behind closed doors. 
    We're modeling the behavior we want to see.

    <h3>Inviting Collaboration</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Good ideas get better when exposed to feedback. By making our proposal public, we 
    invite input from colleagues, other government agencies, civic technologists, and 
    the broader community. Anyone can open an issue or submit a pull request.

    <h3>Creating a Resource</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    Even if this specific proposal doesn't move forward, the research, analysis, and 
    documentation we create will be available for others. Another agency, another team, 
    or even future us can build on this work.

    <h3>Cultural Shift</h3>
  </div>
  <p>
    The public sector hasn't traditionally worked in the open. We get it—it can feel 
    uncomfortable to share unfinished work. But we believe this is a healthy direction 
    for government innovation:
  </p>
  <ul class="prose">
    <li><strong>Reduces duplication</strong> — others don't have to reinvent the wheel</li>
    <li><strong>Builds trust</strong> — residents can see how decisions are made</li>
    <li><strong>Encourages accountability</strong> — our thinking is documented and reviewable</li>
    <li><strong>Sets an example</strong> — we hope others will follow</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="callout callout--warning">
  <strong>💬 "But what if it's not perfect?"</strong><br>
  That's the point. Open development means sharing work-in-progress, learning publicly, 
  and improving through iteration. Perfection is the enemy of transparency.
</div>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>
  Organizations like <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">18F</a>, 
  the <a href="https://usds.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Digital Service</a>, 
  and <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for America</a> 
  have championed open-source in government for years. The 
  <a href="https://github.com/CFPB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)</a>, 
  <a href="https://github.com/nasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA</a>, and countless 
  municipalities publish code and documentation openly.
</p>

<p>
  We're not doing anything radical—we're joining a growing movement of public servants 
  who believe that working in the open leads to better outcomes for everyone.
