## Scope
- Investigate feasibility and value of an ActivityPub-compatible presence for Public Works.
- Evaluate hosting options without committing yet: self-hosting, third‑party providers (e.g., masto.host), or hosting offered by the Mastodon nonprofit.
- Identify basic requirements for accessibility, moderation, and records considerations to inform a later implementation plan.

## Goals (pilot)
- Validate fit for official updates and audience engagement.
- Document minimal operational requirements and risks.
- Recommend a path forward (or not) with clear tradeoffs and costs.

## Deliverables
- Short proposal for the Innovation Challenge submission.
- Brief options analysis (hosting approaches, pros/cons, estimated costs).
- High-level pilot outline (roles, moderation/accessibility checkpoints) — non-binding.

## Timeline
- Now → January 29: research, provider outreach, options analysis, draft and submit proposal.

## Hosting Options (to evaluate, no decision yet)
- Managed providers (e.g., masto.host).
- Hosting via the Mastodon nonprofit’s institutional offering.
- Self-hosted (County or cloud) as a comparable baseline.

## Prior Pitch & Validation
- Presented at Pasadena City College Business, Entrepreneurship and Technology (BET) Club and Pasadena Small Business Development Center (SBDC) business pitch contest; received an Innovation Award with a $500 prize.
- Original pitch (concept: "CivicSignal" for public‑sector fediverse hosting): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hav67zgPjQl8eQFX-3kh81XhHem1IowO/view?usp=drivesdk

## Next Steps
- Confirm participants and stakeholders to consult.
- Gather requirements and constraints (accessibility, records, security, comms).
- Contact/select a small set of providers for quotes and capabilities.
- Draft and iterate the submission with findings and a recommendation.

## Promotional Site (planned)

- Static site generator to be chosen next week based on simplicity and fit; no implementation in this phase.

## Decision Log
